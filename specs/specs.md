# Specs Directory Overview

This `specs/` folder contains individual feature specification files. Each spec documents a single planned feature—its objectives, design changes, tests, and validation steps—so that Claude Code can consume and implement them consistently.

## Folder Structure

- `specs/`
  - `<feature_name>.md` — one file per feature, named in snake_case.
