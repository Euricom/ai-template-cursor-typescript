# README.md - Cursor Template Project

A modern project structure optimized for efficient AI-assisted development using Cursor.

## Overview

This repository provides a standardized structure for AI-enhanced software development workflows. Rather than directly inputting commands, documentation, and feature requests into the CLI of Cursor, this structure offers a more organized, version-controlled, and collaborative approach to working with AI coding assistants.

## Directory Structure

```

## Key Components

### 1. Claude Commands (`.claude/commands/`)

Custom reusable commands that streamline interactions with Cursor:

- **Project Context Initialization**: The `prime.md` command quickly primes Claude with project structure and important documentation
- **Standardized Workflows**: Create commands for code generation, testing, analysis, and more
- **Invocation Syntax**: Use `/project:command_name` to execute commands

### 2. AI Documentation (`ai_docs/`)

Specialized documentation that enhances AI models' understanding of your project:

- **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: Terminology, architecture, and design patterns
- **Implementation Details**: System relationships and code examples
- **Enhanced Generation**: Helps Claude generate code aligned with your project's patterns
- **Invocation Syntax**: Use `@[path/to/document]` to reference docs in conversations

### 3. Feature Specifications (`specs/`)

Structured specifications for planned features:

- **Implementation Blueprint**: Detailed specs for types, methods, tests, and validation
- **Consistent Design**: Standardized format ensures all necessary details are included
- **AI-Ready Format**: Optimized for consumption by Cursor
- **Invocation Syntax**: Use `@[path/to/spec.md]` to reference in conversations

## Using the Prime Command

The `prime.md` command fills Claude's context window with essential project information:

1. Run `/project:prime` in Cursor
2. Claude will:
   - Display the project structure
   - Read key documentation files
   - Build a comprehensive understanding of the project

This allows Claude to provide more accurate assistance with your project.
