# AI Documentation for Claude Code

## Overview

The `ai_docs` directory provides a structured repository for AI-specific documentation that enhances Claude's understanding of your project. These documents serve as specialized knowledge bases that Claude can reference for deeper context, domain-specific terminology, architectural patterns, and implementation details that might not be readily apparent from code inspection alone.

## Directory Structure

```

    ├── AI_DOCS.md           # This documentation file
    ├── architecture.md      # System architecture documentation
    ├── domain_concepts.md   # Domain-specific terminology and concepts
    ├── design_patterns.md   # Custom design patterns used in the project
    ├── ai_strategy.md       # AI implementation strategy
    └── subdirectories/      # Optional topic-specific documentation

## Documentation File Format

AI documentation files are Markdown (`.md`) documents structured to provide Claude with specific context about various aspects of the system. While there's flexibility in formatting, effective AI documentation typically follows certain patterns to maximize Claude's comprehension.

### Recommended Structure

1. **Title/Header**: Clear identification of the document's purpose
2. **Executive Summary**: Brief overview of the document's content (2-3 sentences)
3. **Detailed Sections**: Organized hierarchically with H2/H3 headers
4. **Technical Terminology**: Definitions of domain-specific terms
5. **Relationships**: Explicit connections between components/concepts
6. **Code References**: References to important code patterns with examples
7. **Diagrams**: Textual or ASCII representations of system relationships (Claude can understand these)
