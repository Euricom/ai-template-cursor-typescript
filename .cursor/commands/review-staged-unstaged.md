## Review Focus Areas

1. **TypeScript Code Quality**
   - Strict TypeScript usage with explicit types
   - No `any` types - use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
   - Proper type imports with `import type { }` syntax
   - Component props interfaces defined
   - Following TypeScript strict mode compliance

2. **Performance & Bundle Optimization**
   - No unnecessary client-side JavaScript
   - Appropriate hydration strategy choices
   - Bundle size considerations
   - No over-hydration of static content

3. **Security & Validation**
   - Input validation with Zod schemas
   - Environment variables properly typed
   - Content Security Policy implementation
   - No hardcoded secrets in client-side code
   - API route validation with proper error handling

4. **Content Management**
   - Content collections properly configured
   - Zod schemas for all content types
   - Type-safe content queries
   - Proper content rendering and data handling

5. **Package Management**
   - Using pnpm (not npm or yarn)
   - Proper dependency management
   - No unused dependencies
   - Correct dev vs runtime dependencies

6. **Code Structure & Architecture**
   - Components under 200 lines (500 line hard limit)
   - Functions under 50 lines with single responsibility
   - Proper separation of concerns
   - Feature-based organization
   - Islands architecture principles followed

7. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - Vitest configuration and tests
   - 80%+ test coverage maintained
   - API route integration tests
   - Proper mocking of external dependencies

8. **Build & Development**
   - ESLint compliance with zero warnings
   - Prettier formatting applied
   - Production build succeeds
   - No hydration mismatches

9.  **Documentation & Maintenance**
    - Clear component interfaces
    - Proper prop descriptions
    - CLAUDE.md updates for new patterns/dependencies
    - README updates if needed
